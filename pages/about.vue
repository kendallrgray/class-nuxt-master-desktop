                    As I write this (2025), I am 24-year-old creative who has been professionally video editing since I was a teenager. However, I've been creating in some form or another since I could talk. I have a passion for storytelling and listening to yours, whether through video, music, painting, drawing, crafting, building, cooking, writing and beyond. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                    I'm from the potato state, just one state over from the cool ones that hug the Pacific ocean. When I was in college (University of Idaho), I studied creative writing, filmmaking and linguistics with an outlier interest in psychology and anthropology. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
                   In 2020, I spearheaded my business of video editing and production, where I worked with a variety of clients, including musicians, artists, content creators, directors, coaches and small businesses. I also have experience in social media management and content creation, which has allowed me to combine my love for storytelling with my skills in modern-age marketing!
