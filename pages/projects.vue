                        <p class="text-black p-4">When I was sick and homebound for 200+ days, I took my journaling obsession, combined it with one-part therapy tools and two-parts artistic catharsis, and made a book that can be filled out by anyone. A boatload of fun to existential questions; by the end of it, you'll know more about yourself. I'll bet you two orders of french fries.</p>

                        <p class="text-black p-4">When I was 4, I wished for a guitar and a female guitar teacher. I started writing songs at 5. I've played piano since I was 10. Since then, I'd written (and since unpublished) hundreds of songs, and was never truly connected to them. This, however, I like. I spent 4+ years creating this in the basement bedroom of my parents' house!</p>

Main theme: Coming of Age meets self-vs-self meets romance. Subtheme: Parapsychology. Special feature: a cat named Booth.</p>
